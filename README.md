# lnforum-ui-core

Yet another repo! YAR! We will try to split the core UI routines out from any of the frameworks I use. So, for example, we may eventually have the following:

- lnforum-ui-reactflux
- lnforum-ui-reflex
- lnforum-ui-cli
- lnforum-ui-...

Thus, all of those libraries will use ln-core as their base.
